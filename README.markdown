FAQ
---

*What is this ?*
An open repository for common but kind of advanced javascript components written with Backbone.js

*What are the dependencies ?**
There is of course underscore.js. It also works with jquery or zepto.

*How to use/install ?*
Check the sample and the tests. In the sample, check the inline javascrip at the end of the page to see how to initialize the component. It's pretty straightforward. To help you a bit more, there is a readme in every component directory.

*Can I contribute ?*
Yes. Make a pull request and I'll look into it with pleasure :)

*Why should I use?*
There are tests, and the code is pretty clear and easy to read, so you can change it to match your needs. Also : boobs.
